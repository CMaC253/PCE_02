# PCE_02 BIT 142 Cascadia College
C# Exercises

## Please consider the following:
 If you clone the project and run it in VS you will notice you can debug different functions because they all will be ran at once.

### The Following topics are displayed here:
  - Conditional Statements (If..Else if.. Else, Switch statements)
  - Compaison Operators
  - IO Operators
  - Integer and Read Division
  - Modulus
  - Logical Operators (Answers are commented out)
  
```
Open at Program.cs in the top folder to analyze the code
```

Not all of the functions will be filled out but at this portion of the class we did not have NUnit tests to consider.
